# Templates of commonly used files

## CV

My current various CV in LaTeX. Not directly compilable since many heavy packages are required.
Just use OverLeaf for convenience.

## Pandoc markdown

I use pandoc to convert all my report and slide at school to pdf. The `pandoc_markdown` folder
contains template for simple report, slide and fancy report.

## Repo init file

Commonly used file to quickly initialize some repository/project.
