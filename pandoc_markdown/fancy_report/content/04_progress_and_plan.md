# Progress and future plan

## Current progress

I set 4 main objective for the current project stage. For each of them, I will give my assessment on
the current progress done:

- RISC-V processor model (100%): Currently done. I have already read enough about the RISC-V
specification and processor model to decide on what to implement.

- Architecture design and implementation (70%): Currently not done. The design has been set. But
implementation is still underway.

- Validation and benchmark strategy (60%): Only much of the validation process has been laid out.
Detail is severely lacking in performance benchmarking.

## Plan for next stage

1. Finish implementation
2. Perform verification for the design on RTL level
3. Research and laid out a more concrete plan for performance testing
4. FPGA implementation and running benchmark.
