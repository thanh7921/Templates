    abstract = {This book is about the Zynq-7000 All Programmable System on Chip, the family of devices from Xilinx that combines an application-grade ARM Cortex-A9 processor with traditional FPGA logic fabric. Catering for both new and experienced readers, it covers fundamental issues in an accessible way, starting with a clear overview of the device architecture, and an introduction to the design tools and processes for developing a Zynq SoC. Later chapters progress to more advanced topics such as embedded systems development, IP block design and operating systems. Maintaining a 'real-world' perspective, the book also compares Zynq with other device alternatives, and considers end-user applications. The Zynq Book is accompanied by a set of practical tutorials hosted on a companion website. These tutorials will guide the reader through first steps with Zynq, following on to a complete, audio-based embedded systems design.}
